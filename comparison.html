	      Differences with coreboot
	    </h3>

	    <p>
	      While Librecore shares much of its source code with coreboot, and
	      also collaborates with coreboot, and even sends patches to
	      coreboot, there are also some differences between the two
	      projects.
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      While the differences are subject to the evolution of both
	      projects and their members, so far we identified some below.
	    </p>

	    <h4>
	      <a id="freedom" class="anchor"
		 href="#freedom" aria-hidden="true">
		<span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span>
	      </a>
	      Freedom
	    </h4>

	    <p>
	      To support some devices, coreboot uses Huge silicon manufacturer
	      provided blobs like AMD's PI and Intel's FSP.<br>
	      Such blobs are responsible for enabling most of the hardware,
	      which is what coreboot is supposed to do in the first place. This
	      relegates coreboot to a wrapper of such blobs, leaving it very few
	      things left to do.
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      Because of that Librecore chose not to use such blobs. As a result
	      of that, the hardware requiring such blobs is supported by
	      coreboot but not librecore.
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      When such blobs are optional, not having the option to use them is
	      less confusing for users and/or developers.
	    </p>

	    <h4>
	      <a id="maintanability" class="anchor"
		 href="#maintanability" aria-hidden="true">
		<span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span>
	      </a>
	      Maintanability
	    </h4>

	    <p>
	      Coreboot uses Silicon manufacturer provided free software source
	      code (Like AMD's AGESA) that don't follow the same design or code
	      practices than the community is used to:<br>
	      Such source code often contains a layer to abstract the OS or,
	      here the boot firmware project it's used with. This is a well
	      known issue<a id="ref-ptr-1" class="anchor" href="#ref-1">[1]</a>
	      in free software projects that interact with hardware. While such
	      code is really valuable as it provides a good working reference,
	      but it has huge maintainability issues.<br>
	      The Linux kenrel also has to deal with this issue, and because of
	      the maintability issues, decided not to use that kind of code
	      as-is.
	    </p>
